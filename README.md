# Hello, I'm Mazen 😄

I'm a **senior** computer science student at the American University of Bahrain.  
I fell in love with building things in high school and have continued to pursue this path until now.  

I am currently the **Co-Founder & CTO of UniComm** — a student event/opportunity discovery app, and for my **capstone project** I am building a curriculum management system **commissioned by AUBH**, to be used in production starting next academic semester.

### ***UniComm***  

This is my startup, we are building Bahrain's first student discovery and ticketing app.

### ***ClubAir***  

This was my first production level application.  
It was built for a trampoline park called ClubAir in New Jersey.  

The app's purpose is to allow ClubAir easier access to its clients via push notifications and to allow their clients faster access to tickets.

### ***Zumaar***  

This project was built for a daycare in new jersey, where staff count must be maintained according to how many children are at the daycare.  

The calculations used to be done manually at this and other daycares accross the US.  
This app solves that.

### ***Green Medical Marketing Landing Page***  

Green International Medical contacted me to create a landing page for their newest product, and their marketing campaign.  

Using Codex, we were able to create this in a matter of days.  
It is a SPA and allows users to book meetings via a google calendar embed.

### ***UniComm Website***  

While our sales funnel at this moment in time is largely focused on manual outreach, it was important for us to create a website.  

This is a SPA built with Codex in a couple of hours.
