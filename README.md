# Hello, I'm Mazen 😄

I'm a **senior** computer science student at the American University of Bahrain. I fell in love with building things in high school and have continued to pursue this path until now. I am currently the **Co-Founder & CTO of UniComm** a student event/opportunity discovery app, and for my **capstone project** I am building a curriculum management system **commissioned by AUBH**, to be used in production starting next academic semester.
